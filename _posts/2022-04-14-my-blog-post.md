1. Reconnaissance

The attacker collects data about the target and the tactics for the attack. This includes harvesting email addresses and gathering other information. 

Automated scanners are used by intruders to find points of vulnerability in the system. This includes scanning firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, etc to get a point of entry for the attack.

2. Weaponization

Attackers develop malware by leveraging security vulnerabilities. Attackers engineer malware based on their needs and the intention of the attack. This process also involves attackers trying to reduce the chances of getting detected by the security solutions that the organization has in place.

3. Delivery

The attacker delivers the weaponized malware via a phishing email or some other medium. The most common delivery vectors for weaponized payloads include websites, removable disks, and emails. This is the most important stage where the attack can be stopped by the security teams.  

4. Exploitation

The malicious code is delivered into the organization’s system. The perimeter is breached here. And the attackers get the opportunity to exploit the organization’s systems by installing tools, running scripts, and modifying security certificates. 

Most often, an application or the operating system’s vulnerabilities are targeted. Examples of exploitation attacks can be scripting, dynamic data exchange, and local job scheduling.

5. Installation

A backdoor or remote access trojan is installed by the malware that provides access to the intruder. This is also another important stage where the attack can be stopped using systems such as HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention System).

6. Command and Control

The attacker gains control over the organization’s systems and network. Attackers gain access to privileged accounts and attempt brute force attacks, search for credentials, and change permissions to take over the control.

7. Actions on Objective

The attacker finally extracts the data from the system. The objective involves gathering, encrypting, and extracting confidential information from the organization’s environment. 

Based on these stages, the following layers of control implementation are provided:

    Detect – Determine the attempts to penetrate an organization.
    Deny – Stopping the attacks when they are happening.
    Disrupt – Intervene is the data communication done by the attacker and stops it then.
    Degrade – This is to limit the effectiveness of a cybersecurity attack to minimize its ill effects.
    Deceive – Mislead the attacker by providing them with misinformation or misdirecting them.
    Contain – Contain and limit the scope of the attack so that it is restricted to only some part of the organization.
